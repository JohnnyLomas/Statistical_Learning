# Exercise 1. (Theoretical Question) – 3 pts
Given a data set $(\overrightarrow{x}_1,y_1), . . . , (\overrightarrow{x}_N , y_N )$, with $y_i \in \bigl\{ −1, +1 \bigr\}$. For maximizing the margin problem, the constraints are $\overrightarrow{\omega}^T \overrightarrow{x_i} + \omega_0 \geq 1$ for $y_i = +1$ and $\overrightarrow{\omega}^T \overrightarrow{x_i} + \omega_0 \leq -1$ for $y_i = −1$. Restate the quadratic
maximization problem when $\omega_0 = 1$. What are the constraints?

## Solution:
When $\omega_0 = 1$ the constraints become $\overrightarrow{\omega}^T \overrightarrow{x_i} \geq 0$ for $y_i = +1$ and $\overrightarrow{\omega}^T \overrightarrow{x_i} \leq 0$ for $y_i = −1$.

The quadratic maximization problem then becomes

\begin{aligned}
L_p = \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{\omega}^T \overrightarrow{\omega} - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i y_i (\overrightarrow{\omega}^T \overrightarrow{x_i} + 1) + \sum_{i=1}^N \alpha_i
\end{aligned}

#Exercise 2. (Programming) – 12 pts
Write a computer program to classify two classes in the dataset data.csv. Please fit Support Vector
Machine via maximizing optimization problem with the constraints and ω0 = 1 stated in Exercise 1
and use stochastic optimization. The binary dataset contains 20 observations, where 10 of them are in
Class -1 and the other 10 observations are in Class +1. The dataset can be downloaded from https:

#Exercise 3. (Programming) – 15 pts
The dataset data.csv contains 20 observations, where 10 of them are in Class -1 and the other 10
observations are in Class +1, which can be downloaded from the link in Exercise 2. Apply Bootstrap on
data.csv to compute 100 linear cuts between two classes by selecting bootstrap dataset with replacement.
Then compute and plot the average cut.
